This project presents a simulation of a hospital equipped with three robots that communicate with a central control system through a user-friendly interface (developed with Qt Creator on a Raspberry Pi 4). The robots receive orders and perform tasks such as delivering food and medicine to patient rooms and retrieving reports for doctors.

The hospital is spread across two floors. The ground floor houses a food and medicine store, a report collection area, and a recharging station where robots automatically dock to recharge when their batteries are low, without human intervention. There's also an elevator with a continuous sterilization mechanism.

The robots are controlled via a touchscreen connected to the Raspberry Pi 4. In this project, we utilized various algorithms, including Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path from the robot's current position to its target, and a real-time system to ensure smooth operation.
